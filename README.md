This repository contains the source code for the simulation study in the paper "Minimax rates in variance and covariance changepoint testing" by Per August Jarval Moen. 

The repository consists of two self-contained Jupyter Notebook files. The first file, 'simulation_univariate.ipynb', is the code for the univariate simulation study. 
The second file, 'simulation_multivariate.ipynb' contains the code for the multivariate simulation study. Note that the latter file must be edited if the software MOSEK is
not installed on the host machine. The notebook contains instructions on what needs to be changed.
